									<h4>A more peaceful start was meant to be a  playlist for listening to as I focus on myself, the start of a new year of school, and cultivating a calm mindset in the midst of stress. Some of the songs aren't peaceful at all actually— been into hyper dnb and some weird techno stuff lately— but this time period for me is a time of peace, presence, and self-acceptance.</h4>
