									<h3 class="major">Love, the sweater thief</h3>
									<h4>march 21st, 2022<br>
										Poems with concise rhyme schemes have been really healing for me lately. Maybe the loop
										of a rhyme provides a sort of closure and predictability that is comforting.</h4>
									<p> Fear in the fabric<br>
										Loss in the loom<br>
										Woven so tragic<br>
										Garments consume.</p>

									<p>	Blue jacket so gentle<br>
										Folded through haze<br>
										To wear makes me mental<br>
										To keep still delays</p>

									<p>	Healing so slow<br>
										Stitching sincere<br>
										Rosy cheeks just for show<br>
										The cloth getting sheer</p>

									<p>	Wearing what hurts.<br>
										My closet knows grief<br>
										Bet you’re buying new shirts.<br>
										Love, the sweater thief.</p>


									<h3 class="major">broadripple</h3>
									<h4>march 16th, 2023</h4>
				
									<p>Music in the shower<br>
										Music every hour<br>
										Can’t stand the echo you left behind in all your silent power.</p>

										<p>Music as I understand the brain<br>
										Music that sounds better in the rain<br>
										I still tear up on the last refrain.</p>

										<p>Music soaked up with newfound rage<br>
										Music that makes me feel my age<br>
										Screaming lungs contained in fragile rib cage.</p>

										<p>Music as I glide and shave<br>
										Music that knows just what I crave<br>
										I wish it wasn’t one of the songs that you gave.</p>

										<p>Music that has me by the throat<br>
										Music I’ve learned simply by rote.<br>
										Music that kills me before the last note.</p>


									<h3 class="major">sumo season</h3>
									<h4>march 12th, 2023<br>
										This one was inspired by a conversation I had with friends on a tiny beach at sunset.<br>
										Dedicated to finding ourselves alongside lovely little humans who are doing the same thing.</h4>
									<p> I eat my orange alone<br>
										And sometimes I eat the rind<br>
										Because if I can make the bitter sweet,<br>
										Months of tears can be redefined.</p>

										<p>Each carpel peels off slowly<br>
										Teaching me to listen, to stop and hear.<br>
										Who knew citrus had so many lessons?<br>
										Only March and it’s been a long year.</p>

										<p>I can smell it on my fingertips<br>
										Infatuated with the taste.<br>
										Juice grazes each thought of my wandering mind<br>
										Unbothered, unsettled, unchaste.</p>

										<p>When will I ever learn?<br>
										Maybe once orange season ends too soon.<br>
										Just when I got used to golden fruit<br>
										On each lonely afternoon.</p>

									
									<h3 class="major">If I had grown up with brothers</h3>
									<h4>march 1st, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										What would they have thought of me?<br>
										Nothing but an X<br>
										A soft gaze, light hands<br>
										In their world of mastery and charge.<br></p>

										<p>Would they have seen my skill?<br>
										Or noticed my nuanced understanding<br>
										My faceted wit<br>
										My linear mind or my desire for more?<br></p>

										<p>Would they have been threatened?<br>
										By the commitment,<br>
										The burning incessant route I take,<br>
										Gnawing my way up<br>
										Because I see what I can be.<br>
										My deep knowing that it’s on the same plane.<br>
										So close they can’t stand in my way.<br></p>

										<p>If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would my dad have loved them more?<br>
										Would my spirit have been muddled<br>
										By less fatherly love?<br>
										Not that there was much<br>
										But still enough.<br></p>

										<p>Would his teaching hands<br>
										Be replaced by teaching gloves<br>
										Catching their baseballs<br>
										70 miles per hour.<br>
										Like my heart.<br>
										No, my head.<br>
										Would I have had to beg to be seen?<br></p>

										<p>Not begging now,<br>
										But I’m moving at the speed of a light with too many corners to illuminate.<br>
										Too much momentum to stop and wonder<br>
										If I had grown up with brothers<br>
										Would they love me more than my sisters do?<br>
										Would I value their bond over my work?<br>
										Would I feel protected,<br>
										A desire that I loathe calling mine?<br>
										Would they have made me feel strong behind their armor<br>
										Or too weak to defend my home of skin and bones?<br></p>

										<p>So many what-if’s.<br>
										Femininity amplified by the thought of men;<br>
										God, I can’t escape it.<br>
										Masculinity complacent, just beneath the surface<br>
										When I need it now the most.<br>
										I think I would have liked brothers.<br></p>

									
									<h3 class="major">eyes to salt.</h3>
									<h4>february 20th, 2023</h4>
										<p> 
										Every color I write in has a shade of despair,<br>
										Sadness I don’t even know exists until I make it into words.<br>
										Turquoise, azure, navy, or midnight blue all look the same.<br>
										The sentences themselves create new flavors of sorrow.<br></p>

										<p>My words lay down fresh paths for me to crawl along<br>
										Soil beneath my nails.<br>
										It feels so thick, dense with a <br>truth that follows me despite my attempts to leave it behind.<br></p>

										<p>My words are made of lines and curves. <br>
										So sterile and uniform<br>
										That what they imply could only be so<br>
										Raw, visceral, unkempt, stabbing.<br>
										My words love irony.<br></p>

										<p>And I love my words.<br>
										Addicted to the pain that they make me feel,<br>
										Help me feel.<br>
										The way they reopen tender pink scars,<br>
										micro-wounds I don’t notice<br>
										Until my entire body bleeds.<br></p>

										<p>And then I use those drops to finish my paragraph.<br>
										Blood to paper, skin to soil, eyes to salt.<br></p>


									<h3 class="major">Waiting</h3>
									<h4>february 12th, 2023</h4>
										<p>
											A city so warm but it leaves me so cold.<br>
										A city of forks and knives behold.<br>
										A disposable I developed three months too late,<br>
										Pictures dusting so neatly while I silently wait.</p>

										<p>How vain of me to think that your words were meant for me.<br>
										How vain of me to steal them, the first two lines a plea.<br>
										Desperation’s not the title, or at least not the one I claim.<br>
										Been through all five stages, I suppose I’ve made it to shame.</p>

										<p>Built a domain all to myself, twelve whole dollars a year.<br>
										It’s full of my heart’s fabric, corralled by my career.<br>
										Strawberries on my birthday, chlorine in our pores.<br>
										Twenty-three’s cedar so much sweeter than twenty-four’s.</p>

										<p>My eyes would look the same again, chocolate, knowing, clear.<br>
										Playlists laced with melodies that I can’t stand to hear.<br>
										Longer for-loops, same strumming pattern, at least I am creating.<br>
										I’ll drink bitter coffee and relish in my books, but just know that I’m waiting.</p>


									<h3 class="major">Mars is dead.</h3>
									<h4>february 10th, 2023</h4>
										<p>I feel through these words when I cannot feel the rest.<br>
										The way that hell looks like my street leaves me so impressed.<br>
										I can’t believe I used to overlook dead trees, dead Dads, dead stars.<br>
										I could see them in the astral realm on my sleepy way to Mars.</p>

										<p>I remember floating through punctuated black, the violet light unrefined.<br>
										Dissolving my fears, lifting my soul, intuition so entwined.<br>
										I traced Orion’s belt with my eyelashes and cradled his buckle in my lips.<br>
										Until it wrapped around the slim of my neck, dragging me toward eclipse.</p>

										<p>Have they found life there yet, on its softly dusted red barren face?<br>
										I’m on my way so I’ll let you know but I think it might be wrong time, right space.<br>
										My arteries are dry from wandering in this universe of my own unraveled head.<br>
										If they’re any forewarning of what’s to come, I have a feeling Mars will be dead.</p>

										<p>Don’t shoot the messenger, I still want to live, if only for the hope of a sprout.<br>
										I see light in the distance, it could be the end, or it could be my only way out.</p>


									<h3 class="major">My favorite bones</h3>
									<h4>december 2nd, 2022<br>
									honorable mention in 2023 William Carlos Williams poetry competition sponsored by the Northeast Ohio Medical University</h4>
									
										<p>Scapula, because it was the first bone I learned.<br>
										Lunate, because it reminds me of the moon.<br>
										Sternum, because it’s close to my heart.</p>

										<p>No, I’m choosing to remember wrong.<br>
										Scapula, because that was what broke.<br>
										Along with two ribs.<br>
										Lunate, because your hand couldn’t soften your fall.<br>
										The hand of a surgeon.<br>
										Sternum, because it was close to your heart.</p>

										<p>Bones are all that’s left.<br>
										My vertebrae remember your hands<br>
										Checking for scoliosis<br>
										But the spines of your favorite books remain unbent.<br>
										Sandpaper stiff.</p>

										<p>And you never told me about your working days<br>
										But I heard the stories, still.<br>
										What happened?<br>
										Swallow.<br>
										Hard pill.<br>
										Coughing it up as I read my speech<br>
										Coffin at foot.</p>

										<p>Oh, these are my favorite bones.<br>
										They said twenty-two was too young<br>
										To say goodbye to a father<br>
										Even though I mourned my youth<br>
										The first time you forgot my age.<p>

										<p>At least I have my favorite bones…<br>
										Not your hands, your dementia, nor you.<br>
										But I know I’ll love them always,<br>
										Through crepitus and blue.</p>
